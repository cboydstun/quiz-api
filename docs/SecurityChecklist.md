# GraphQL API Security Audit Checklist

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Ensure all non-public endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Use secure methods for storing and comparing passwords (e.g., bcrypt)
- [ ] Implement JWT token expiration and rotation
- [ ] Secure the JWT secret key and consider using asymmetric keys
- [ ] Implement logout functionality to invalidate tokens

## 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

- [ ] Validate and sanitize all input data
- [ ] Implement query depth limiting to prevent nested query attacks
- [ ] Set a maximum limit on the number of objects that can be requested in a single query
- [ ] Implement query complexity analysis to prevent resource-intensive queries

## 3. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up DDoS protection (consider using a service like Cloudflare)
- [ ] Monitor and alert on unusual traffic patterns

## 4. Error Handling and Information Disclosure

- [ ] Ensure error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Implement proper error logging without exposing sensitive data
- [ ] Use a generic error message for the client while logging detailed errors server-side

## 5. Data Protection

- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all communications
- [ ] Implement proper database security measures (e.g., least privilege access)
- [ ] Regularly backup data and test restore procedures

## 6. API Specific Security

- [ ] Implement introspection and field suggestions security in production
- [ ] Use persisted queries to prevent arbitrary queries in production
- [ ] Implement proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies

## 7. Dependency Management

- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use tools like npm audit or Snyk to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies

## 8. Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for security events
- [ ] Set up real-time alerting for suspicious activities
- [ ] Regularly review logs for security incidents

## 9. Server and Infrastructure Security

- [ ] Keep server software and OS updated
- [ ] Implement proper firewall rules
- [ ] Use the principle of least privilege for all service accounts

## 10. Security Headers

- [ ] Implement proper security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-XSS-Protection)
- [ ] Use Helmet.js or similar middleware to set security headers

## 11. GraphQL Specific Vulnerabilities

- [ ] Protect against batch attacks by limiting the number of operations per request
- [ ] Implement proper error masking to prevent information leakage
- [ ] Use aliases judiciously and consider implementing alias limiting

## 12. Testing

- [ ] Conduct regular penetration testing
- [ ] Implement automated security testing in your CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Perform regular code reviews with a focus on security

## 13. Compliance

- [ ] Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Implement necessary data handling and user consent mechanisms

## 14. Incident Response Plan

- [ ] Develop and maintain an incident response plan
- [ ] Regularly conduct drills to test the incident response plan

Remember to regularly revisit and update this checklist as new security threats emerge and best practices evolve.
